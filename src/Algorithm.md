# Algorithm and Design

## Convex Hull problem:
- Convex-Hull problems is a polygon that contain all the point:
  - Graham Scan O(nlogn)
  - Jarvis March O(nh)

## Merge Sort:
- [video of implement merge sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q&t=509s)
- For the Mergesort algorithm, we can show that T(n) = Θ(n log2 n). It is outperforms insertion sort with running time is Θ(n2)
