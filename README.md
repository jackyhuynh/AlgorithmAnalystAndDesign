# Algorithm and Design

## Introduction:
Algorithm and design(SDF)
- Concept and properties of algorithms,
- Role of algorithms,
- Problem-solving strategies,
- Separation of behavior and implementation

Software development Fundamental (SDF)

### Algorithm
- a well-defined procedure
- a sequence of unambiguous instructions 
- for solving a well-specified computational problem
- for obtaining a desired, required output 
- from any given legitimate input 
- in a finite amount of time.

### Logical methods of checking correctness of an algorithm with respect to its input and output.
- Testing
- Correctness proof
- Confidence in algorithms from testing and correctness proof
- Correctness of recursive algorithms: prove directly by induction
- Correctness of iterative algorithms:   prove using loop invariants and induction

## Solutions:
- Divide and Conquer
  - Break problem into sub-problems
  - Solve each of the sub-problem
  - Combine the solution to obtain the solution to the original problem

## Convex Hull problem:
- Convex-Hull problems is a polygon that contain all the point:
  - Graham Scan O(nlogn)
  - Jarvis March O(nh)

## Merge Sort:
- [video of implement merge sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KF2j-9iSf4Q&t=509s)
- For the Mergesort algorithm, we can show that T(n) = Θ(n log2 n). It is outperforms insertion sort with running time is Θ(n2)
